# Learning with Errors 

This is a basic cryptographic implementation of Oded Regev's Learning with Errors problem

## Process
[Basic LWE Cipher implementation](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/lwe2)

After running through his implementation and understanding each step of the LWE process,
I used [<i>Oded Regev's The Learning with Errors Problem<i>](https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/papers/lwesurvey.pdf) and implemented the process
discussed in Cryptographic Applications (Chapter 4).

This section is more detailed and provides some additional information about how to pick 
a prime modulus to ensure security and correctness
